# Autonomous optimization pilot report

Pilot ID: `pilot-2026-11-06-01`  
Configuration PR: [#678](https://github.com/HamedGithubforwork/QuizForge-AI/pull/678)  
Status: active, bounded to five implementation cycles

## Cycle 1 — blocker fallback

- Domain: reliability
- Task: `autonomy-bridge-blocker-fallback`
- Baseline: 0 independent-fallback policy/test paths at base commit `aad0afeda769a6715f2ba8351294b61839ff5fe6`.
- Result: 1 deterministic fallback path after the change at commit `3b6637d4574916d0d7117b142e1caf3d4e4f3835`.
- Measurement: the orchestrator test verifies that recording a blocker immediately selects independent actionable work; the workflow instruction now preserves that behavior after a repeated failure. This is a policy and deterministic state-machine measurement, not evidence of a live GitHub workflow launching a second task.
- Validation: focused suite passed 26/26; Reviewer, QA, Release Reliability, and Security assessments passed. No grounding, grading, or quiz-quality safeguards were changed.
- Security caveat: a retry of matching failed Actions checks can consume GitHub Actions minutes; no retry was manually triggered. Queue text remains untrusted input for downstream readers.

## Audit 1 — new CI coverage opportunity confirmed

The first complete discovery pass covered all fourteen required dimensions. QA identified the missing PR coverage; Reviewer, Security/Privacy, Performance Efficiency, and Release Reliability independently confirmed it. AI Quality reported that #664's sanitized evidence remains unavailable and #665 is already represented by an existing PR. UI/UX and Data Integrity found no separate actionable opportunity.

## Cycle 2 — diagnostic privacy tests in PR CI

- Domain: CI efficiency and reliability
- Task: `desktop-diagnostic-pr-tests`
- Baseline: 0 of the four diagnostic tests ran in PR CI at base commit `aad0afeda769a6715f2ba8351294b61839ff5fe6`.
- Result: all 4 tests run when the diagnostic helper or test changes, using Node 22; the job is included in the required PR gate. Implementation commit: `460132dbe087481420943f7331f99a961d0a69d1`.
- Validation: local `node --test desktop/test/diagnose-targeted-practice.test.cjs` passed 4/4; the orchestrator suite passed 26/26; Reviewer, QA, Performance, and Security passed. No model, runtime, AWS, or other external service is used.
- Cost note: one PR update that changes `ci.yml` activates the existing backend, frontend, and Playwright jobs. The repository is public and those jobs use standard GitHub-hosted Linux runners; ordinary later edits to the diagnostic helper/test only run the focused job.

## Current checkpoint

- Completed optimization cycles: 2 of 5 maximum
- Remaining actionable tasks: none in the current backlog.
- Blocked: Local Qwen #664 needs unavailable sanitized diagnostic evidence; #665 is already covered by an existing PR.
- Next step: run a second complete, independent repository-wide discovery audit. If it finds no worthwhile actionable improvements and no resource/approval blocker, only then may the Coordinator run a separate confirming audit before declaring exhaustion. A credible specialist finding returns to implementation; unresolved unavailable evidence remains `BLOCKED`.
